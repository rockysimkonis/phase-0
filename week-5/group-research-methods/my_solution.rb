# Person 1's solution

# Pseudocode
# Input: array, string
# Steps:
#   Create a new array
#   Using loop, iterate through the array list (word)
#     Create new variable to store word, convert it to strings and letters (using split method)
#     IF any of the words has "letter"
#       add to new array
#    Skip to next word
#   return new list
# Output: array

    if splitted_word.include?(thing_to_find)
      new_list << word
    end
  end

end
# Pseudocode
# Input: hash, integer
# Steps:
#   Create a new array
#   Using loop, iterate through the hash list (key and value)
#     IF value equal to thing_to_find
#       store key of that value to new array list
#    return new list
# Output: array

def my_array_modification_method!(array, increase)

  hash.each do |key, value|
    hash[key] = value + increase
  end
  return hash
end


# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# For the array modification I used a loop to iterate through each item and checking if an integer exists using is_a? method. If it exists then increase the value and replace with existing.
# For the hash modification I used the each method to traverse through each key value pair and add the increased value.

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
=begin
For the array I used .each, .is_a?, .push, .sort, .sort!, and .concat. .each was used to iterate through the array. .is_a? was used to seperate the integers from the strings in the array. .push was used to add the integers or strings to their new array. .sort was used to sort the string array. .sort! was used to sort the number array. .concat was used to append the string array to the number array, and create the sorted array.
For the hash sorting I used .sort_by. By using that I was able to sort the hash by the value instead of the keys.

# The method I used was .delete_if. It deletes any element that the block evaluate to true.

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# I used .each, .push, and .is_a?. .push is used for pushing objects to an array, .each is used to iterate through an array or hash, and .is_a? checks if the object being given is a member of a certain class (in this case integers).
