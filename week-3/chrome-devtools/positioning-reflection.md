How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
[RS] Youc an navigate through each one of the elemnts and modify the CSS.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
[RS] Using the width and height properties.

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
Static is using the normal behavor layed out in current postition.
Relative is laying out elemnts as they were not positioned and then adjusting them without modifying the layout.
Absolute means there is not additional space for the element.
Fixed is not leaving space for element and does not move when scrolled.
Statis was easiest to use.

What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
Margin is outer box, border is around the margin, and padding is inside the box.
