// __________________________________________
// Reflection
/*
What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?
[RS] It can be very initmidating and difficult. Learning the difference between bracket and dot notation helps signicicantly.

Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?
[RS] Yes, the for each loop.


What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?
[RS] Using objects in javascript and updating count values.
