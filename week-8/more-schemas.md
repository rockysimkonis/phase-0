## What is a one-to-one database?
One to one database is when you have two or more tables that share the same key. It is basically chunking the table out into less usable items. So if an identifier is used less often it can be placed in a seperate table tied to the same id for faster indexing.

## When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
To increase performance of searching.

## What is a many-to-many database?
A database where you have many tables connected to many tables with an unlimited amount in any direction.

## When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
When you have a product and need to know the customer name, order amount, and type. All of these need to be tracked together.


## What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
Lots of it is confusing because most of what we are learning is still theoretical.
