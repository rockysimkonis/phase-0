#  Reflection
=begin

What did you learn about making code readable by working on this challenge?
[RS] Break things apart and discard what is not needed

Did you learn any new methods? What did you learn about them?
[RS] Yes, I learned the has_value? method on hashes

What did you learn about accessing data in hashes?
[RS] Not too much, some of the array notation rubs off which can be confusing with indexes.

What concepts were solidified when working through this challenge?
[RS] Working with hash data structures
