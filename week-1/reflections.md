# 1.1 Think About Time
The time management and productivity ideas that I learned are forming good habits and surrendering poor ones, practicing meditation, and time boxing. Time boxing is setting time blocks to accomplish certain tasks. After the time block is up, you reflect back on what you accomplished instead of continuously plowing through more tasks.



Currently I plan my days ahead. So after work I know that from 8:00PM to 10:00PM I will dedicate time for practicing programming. In that time frame I give myself about 30mins for breaks. The strategy is not super effective because I tend to get distracted more often that not, so I end up practicing past 10:00PM on many occasions.

I have been practicing mindfulness meditation for about 8months now and plan to incorporate the pomodoro technique as this way I can be more consistent with progress.



My plan is to not leave everything for last minute, instead working in small chunks every day.

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning

Steps:

1. In your Github account, click the + button in top right, and select 'New Repository'. This will create a new repo.

2. Open repo that you want to fork, and click the fork button.

3. To clone it, open command line tools, and type 'git clone < weblink to repo>



Struggles were learning to which repo I should fork files.
