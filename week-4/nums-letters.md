#Nums and Letters

Puts returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line.

Integer is a number without a decimal value. A float is a number is floating values.

The main difference between an integer and flaot is that floats have decimals.

## This program calculates hours in a year

```
days_year = 365
hours_day = 24

# Hours per year = days per year * hours per day
hours_year = days_year * hours_day

#Print number of hours in a year to console
puts "There are  #{hours_year} in a year"
```


##Calculate number of minutes in decade

```
decade = 10
hours_year = 8760
hours_min = 60

#Expression calculates number of minutes in a decdade
minutes_decade = decade * hours_year * hours_min

#Prints result to console
puts "There are #{minutes_decade} minutes in a decade"
```

## Reflection
How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
[RS] It does simple arithmetic just like a calculator using symbols. Such as '+' for addition.

What is the difference between integers and floats?
[RS] Integers do not have decimal values and round down, while floats have decimal values.

What is the difference between integer and float division?
[RS] Float will have a decimal value, while integer will round down.

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
[RS] Strings are groups of letters. You would use them to print text.

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
[RS] Local variables are defined within the program. You would use them to assign values.

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
[RS] This challenge was pleasent to do.
